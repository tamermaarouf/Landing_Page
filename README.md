I use HTML5, CSS, Js to
build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
Usability: All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
Styling has been added for active states.
Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using DOM
